# Restful Booker API
Welcome to the Restful Booker API Testing Project!  

Restful Booker API functions as a hotel booking system wherein users can create, update, delete or view booking requests.

## Overview
This project aims to validate the functionality and reliability of all API endpoints, and identify potential issues related to data integrity, error handling, authentication, and system performance.

## Scope of testing

**Functional Testing**  
- Verify the correctness and functionality of all API endpoints as per the API documentation.
- Test various scenarios for booking creation, modification, and cancellation.
- Validate user authentication and authorization mechanisms for protected endpoints.

**Data Validation Testing**  
- Ensure that the API correctly validates input data, rejecting invalid requests.
- Test boundary values for input fields to check for any unexpected behavior.
- Validate the accuracy of data returned in responses.

**Error Handling**  
- Verify that appropriate error codes and messages are returned for invalid requests.
- Check error responses for sensitive information disclosure.
- Validate the API's ability to handle unexpected errors gracefully.

**Performance Testing**  
- Assess the API's response time under normal and peak loads to identify potential bottlenecks.
- Measure the API's throughput and scalability to handle concurrent requests.
